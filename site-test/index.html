The Absolute Essential is a carefully curated set of supplies that we genuinely consider non-negotiable for student life. They’re small, portable, and practical. When you’re already overloaded, the basics matter.

      <h2>We're here to support you</h2>
      <p>
        We know college is hard. Especially when you don't live with your parents or people who take care of you. So we want to make it a little easier by providing the essentials that you absolutely need to get through the day. Essentials include things that prevent small disruptions from becoming hour-long problems, basics like hydration, nutrition, and device power, and supplies that protect attention and reduce unnecessary distractions.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Locally sourced supply</h2>
      <p>
        Procurement is intentionally simple. If something is truly essential, it must be easy to replace quickly.
        In practice, that means we walk to Target and buy it for you. No complicated suppliers, no special orders, and no waiting weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need something that isn’t listed, submit a request and we’ll review it for practical value and availability.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Living a broke college life?</h2>
      <p>
        That's completely fine. Just prepare your essentials kit and leave it in the cart. We won't charge you until you check out, and you can check out at any time — even if it's the middle of a hectic week and you forgot to pack your charger.
